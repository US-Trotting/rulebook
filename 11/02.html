				<li>No person shall claim his own horse, nor shall he claim a horse trained or driven by him.</li>
				<li>No person shall claim more than one horse in a race.</li>
				<li>No qualified owner or his authorized agent shall claim a horse for another person.</li>
				<li>No owner shall cause his or her horse to be claimed directly or indirectly for his or her own account.</li>
				<li>No person shall offer, or enter into an agreement, to claim or not to claim, or attempt to prevent another person from claiming any horse in a claiming race.</li>
				<li>No person shall enter a horse against which there is a mortgage, bill of sale, or lien of any kind, unless the written consent of the holder thereof shall be filed with the track member conducting such claiming race.</li>
				<li>Where a horse drawn to start in a claiming race has been declared to start in a subsequent claiming race, a successful claimant, if any, of the horse in the first race shall have the option of scratching the horse from the subsequent race.</li>
				<li>Any mare which has been bred shall not be declared into a claiming race for at least 30 days following the last breeding of the mare, and thereafter such a mare may only be declared into a claiming race after a veterinarian has pronounced the mare not to be in foal. Any mare pronounced in foal shall not be declared into a claiming race.  Where a mare is claimed out of a claiming race and subsequently proves to be in foal from a breeding which occurred prior to the race from which she was claimed, the claim may be voided by the judges at the option of the claimant provided the mare is subjected to a pregnancy examination within 18 days of the date of the claim, and is found to be pregnant as a result of that pregnancy examination. A claimant seeking to void the claim must file a petition to void said claim with the judges within 10 days after this pregnancy examination and shall thereafter be heard by the judges after due notice of the hearing to the parties concerned.</li>
				<li>No donor mare may be entered into a claiming race between the date of an embryo/ovum transplant and the date of the resulting foal's birth.</li>
