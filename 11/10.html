		<h3>11.10 <u>Post Race Urinalysis Test. </u></h3>
		<p>
A post race urinalysis test shall be taken from any horse claimed out of a claiming race. The original trainer of the horse shall be responsible for the claimed horse until the post-race urine sample is collected. The successful claimant shall have the right to void the claim should the forensic analysis be positive for any prohibited substance.  Where a horse is claimed and within 30 days thereafter it is determined by forensic analysis that the claimed horse had tested positive for a prohibited substance in the race prior to the race from which it was claimed the successful claimant shall also have the right to have the claim voided.
