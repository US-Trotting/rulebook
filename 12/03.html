		<h3>12.03 <u>Postage Meter. </u></h3>
		<p>Where a nomination is received by letter bearing the postage meter date without any postmark placed thereon by the post office department, such postage meter date shall be considered to be a postmark for the purposes of this rule if the letter is actually received within seven days following the closing date of the event. Receipt subsequent to this time of a nomination by letter bearing the metered postmark date shall not be a valid nomination or payment to any event. The metered date must conform to the postmark date as set forth above in order to be valid.
