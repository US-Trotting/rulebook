		<p>      
  
  <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  	<li>The sum contributed by a non-track sponsor shall be considered forfeit and is to be included in the sum distributed in the event the stake or futurity is not raced, provided, however, that for the provisions of this paragraph the term &ldquo;sum contributed&rdquo; shall not include added money to be paid by a track member or other responsible party where the track member or other responsible party is someone other than the stake sponsor. In such a case the stake sponsor shall not be held liable for the payment of the added money.</li>
	<li>If an event is not raced due to circumstances beyond the control of a non-track sponsor then such stake sponsor is not required to contribute a sum as added money but need only refund such nominating, sustaining and starting fees as it has collected toward the canceled event.   </li>
