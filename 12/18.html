		<h3>12.18 <u>Events Raced Under the Elimination Plan.  </u></h3>
		<p>      
  Whenever elimination heats are required or specified in the published conditions, such race shall be raced in the following manner unless otherwise stated in the conditions or conducted under another section of this rule. 
  <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  	<li>The field shall be divided by lot and the first division shall race a qualifying dash for 30&#37; of the purse, the second division shall race a qualifying dash for 30&#37; of the purse and the horses so qualified shall race in the main event for 40&#37; of the purse. The winner of the main event shall be the race winner.</li>
	<li>In the event there are more horses declared to start than can be accommodated by the two elimination dashes, then there will be added enough elimination dashes to take care of the excess. The percentage of the purse raced for each elimination dash will be determined by dividing the number of elimination dashes into 60&#37;. The main event will race for 40&#37; of the purse.
  </li>
  <li>Unless the conditions provide otherwise, if there are two elimination dashes the first four finishers in each dash qualify for the final and if there are ; if three or more elimination dashes, not more than three horses will qualify for the final from each qualifying dash.  In any elimination dash where there are horses unable to finish due to an accident and there are fewer horses finishing than would normally qualify for the final, the additional horses qualifying for the final shall be drawn by lot from among those unoffending horses not finishing.</li>
    <li>All elimination dashes and the concluding heats shall be programmed to be raced upon the same day or night unless special provisions for earlier elimination dashes are set forth in the conditions.  Where the final event is to be conducted on a day subsequent to the eliminations and a qualifying horse is subsequently disqualified by virtue of a positive test, and that disqualification occurs prior to the printing of the program for the final event, the horse moved into a qualifying position by virtue of the positive test shall become eligible for the final event and added to the race in conformity with the conditions of the race.</li>
