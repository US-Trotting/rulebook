		<h3>13.04 <u>Number of Starters.  </u></h3>
		<p>
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
       <li>In any race where the number of horses declared in to start exceeds 11 on a half-mile track, 12 on a 5/8-mile track, or 14 on a larger track, unless lesser numbers are specified in the conditions of the race, the race at the option of the track member conducting same stated before positions are drawn may be raced in elimination heats.</li>
      <li>	In the absence of conditions providing for a lesser number of starters no more than two tiers of horses, allowing eight feet per horse will be allowed to start in any race and in no event shall there be allowed more than 11 starters on a half-mile racetrack, 12 starters on a 5/8-mile racetrack or 14 starters on a larger racetrack. At a county fair or other non-extended meetings where no pari-mutuel wagering is permitted there shall not be more than 10 starters on a half-mile racetrack.</li>
      <li>In overnight events at extended pari-mutuel meetings and other meetings not more than eight horses shall be allowed to start on a half-mile racetrack and not more than ten horses on larger tracks. Trailers are not permitted where the racetrack has room to score all horses abreast allowing eight feet per horse, unless otherwise agreed upon by the track member and representative horsemen's association.  Presiding judges at county fairs, in their discretion, and prior to the draw, shall have the authority to limit the number of starters in a race to a number less than ten, if in their judgment starting ten horses would be unsafe, taking into account the condition of the racetrack, the width of the racetrack and the class of horses participating.</li>
