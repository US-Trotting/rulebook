		<h3>16.11 <u>Starting Two Tiers of Horses.  </u></h3>
		<p>In the event there are two tiers of horses the withdrawing of a horse that has drawn or earned a position in the front tier shall not affect the position of the horses that have drawn or earned positions in the second tier.
  Whenever a horse is withdrawn from any tier horses on the outside move in to fill up the vacancy. Where a horse has drawn a post position in the second tier the driver of such horse may elect to score out behind any horse in the first tier so long as he does not thereby interfere with another trailing horse or deprive another trailing horse of a drawn position.
