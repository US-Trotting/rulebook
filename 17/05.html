		<h3>17.05 <u>Contents of Application for Driver's License.  </u></h3>
		<p>An applicant for a license as a driver must satisfy the Executive Vice-President that he or she possesses the necessary qualifications, both mental and physical and as prescribed by the Rules and Regulations of the USTA to perform the duties required. Elements to be considered among others shall be character, reputation, temperament, experience, knowledge of the rules of racing and duties of a driver.  No application for a driver's license will be accepted from a person who otherwise does not meet the requisite qualifications for membership.</p>
		<p>
			The Executive Vice-President shall require the applicant to:
			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
				<li>(a) Submit evidence of good moral character.</li>
				<li>Submit written evidence of employment or experience as a groom or other related experience along with the application and resume.</li>
				<li>Be at least 14 years of age for a matinee &ldquo;M&rdquo; license. (Effective 05/01/2013)</li>
				<li>Be at least 16 years of age for a qualifying-fair &ldquo;Q/F&rdquo; license.</li>
				<li>Be at least 18 years of age for a provisional &ldquo;P&rdquo; or full &ldquo;A&rdquo; license.  No applicant who has previously held any type of license shall be subsequently denied a driver's license solely on the basis of age.</li>
				<li>Furnish completed application form.  In the case of renewal applications, said application may be submitted by telephone or other approved electronic filing.</li>
				<li>When requested submit evidence of physical ability and/or to submit to a physical examination.</li>
				<li>Submit the names of at least six currently  licensed full &ldquo;A&rdquo; drivers for reference.

				<li>Submit satisfactory evidence of a current eye examination prior to the issuance of the initial license indicating a minimum of 20/40 corrected vision in both eyes or if blind in one eye at least 20/30 corrected vision in the other eye according to certification by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist.  Such examination must be made within 12 months prior to the approval of such application.  </li>
				<li>Drivers may submit a valid eye examination certificate, current within the past twelve months, with each renewal application. Evidence of each eye examination shall be carried on the individual's driver's license.</li>
