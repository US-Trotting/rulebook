		<h3>17.13 <u>Driving Colors.  </u></h3>
		<p>Drivers must wear distinguishing colors and clean white pants and shall not be allowed to start in a race or other public performance unless in the opinion of the presiding judge they are properly dressed.
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
       <li>No person shall drive a horse during the time when colors are required on the racetrack unless wearing a protective helmet of compatible colors with a chin strap in place. Where applicable that helmet shall be as required by the rules or regulations of the appropriate Racing Authority. 
 </li>
 <li>Drivers holding a USTA full &ldquo;A&rdquo; driver's license,  residents of  foreign countries who hold an equivalent license with a foreign association and drivers holding a conditional &ldquo;CD&rdquo; driver's license who formerly held a full &ldquo;A&rdquo; driver's license shall register their driving color design with the USTA.  <p>
Any USTA member or any stable, farm, or corporate name registered with the USTA may register driving color designs. No person, registered stable, farm, or corporation may register more than one design and no two designs may be registered the same. All disputes as to the rights to particular designs shall be settled by the USTA.</p>
<p>
Driving color designs registered with the USTA may be released for re-registration if the person, registered stable, farm or corporation is inactive for a period of 5 consecutive years. Inactivity shall mean not in membership with the USTA or racing under the provisions of Rule 1.03 of these rules.  The registered colors of enshrined members of the Hall of Fame shall not be released except for the use of an immediate family member or other person previously designated in a notarized written statement by the deceased member.
</p>
</li>
<li>Except where the logo conflicts with a titled sponsored event drivers may display company logos, trademarks or other advertising insignias on their driver colors provided the driver is properly authorized by the entity owning the logo.</li>
<li>All logos and trademarks must be in good taste.</li>
<li>The use of a logo or other advertising insignia by a driver although specifically allowed by these Rules shall nevertheless always be subject to scrutiny and evaluation by the judges of a meeting in determining whether said driver is properly dressed.</li>
     </ol>
