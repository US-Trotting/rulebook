		<p>
			<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
				<li><u>Driving a Horse in an Intentional Inconsistent Manner.</u> - Every heat in a race must be contested by every horse in the race and every horse must be driven to the finish. If the judges believe that a horse is being driven, or was driven, with design to prevent his winning a heat or race which he was evidently able to win or is being raced in an intentional inconsistent manner or with intent to perpetrate or to aid a fraud, they shall consider it a violation and the driver and anyone in concert with him or her shall be fined, suspended or expelled. The judges may substitute a competent and reliable driver at any time. The substituted driver shall be paid at the discretion of the judges and the fee retained from the purse money due the horse if any.</li>
				<li><u>Driving a Horse in an Unsatisfactory Manner.</u> - In the event a drive is unsatisfactory due to lack of effort or carelessness and the Judges believe that there is no fraud, gross carelessness or a deliberately inconsistent drive they shall impose a penalty under this sub-section including but not limited to a fine, suspension or revocation.</li>
