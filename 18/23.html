		<h3>18.23 <u>Pylon Violations.  </u></h3>
		<p>If at a racetrack which does not have a continuous solid inside hub rail, a horse or part of the horse's sulky leaves the course by going inside the hub rail or other demarcation which constitutes the inside limits of the course the offending horse shall be placed back one or more positions where in the opinion of the judges the action gave the horse an unfair advantage over other horses in the race, or the action helped the horse improve its position in the race. In addition when an act of interference causes a horse or part of the horse's sulky to cross the inside limits of the course and the horse is placed by the judges the offending horse shall be placed behind the horse with which it interfered.
