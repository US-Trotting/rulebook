		<h3>20.10 <u>Nerved Horses</u></h3>
		<p>
			All horses that have been nerved shall be so designated on the USTA registration certificate and the electronic eligibility and be certified by a practicing veterinarian. It is the responsibility of the owner of the horse at the time the horse is nerved to see that this information is placed on the registration certificate and the electronic eligibility.  No trainer or owner will be permitted to enter or start a horse that is high nerved. It shall be the responsibility of the owner and/or trainer of a horse that has been low-nerved to post on the bulletin board in the racing office at each racetrack where the horse competes the fact that the horse has been low-nerved and it is the responsibility of each track member to provide a space in the racing office where the fact of nerving can be posted in accordance with this rule. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Only the palmar (posterior) digital neurectomy (low nerving) by surgical or other physical (example: freezing) or chemical (example: injecting alcohol) means will be permitted in horses to be raced.  Only the posterior digital nerve and middle branches to the palmar (posterior) (back) part of the foot may be desensitized.  This procedure must be done below the fetlock.  The dorsal (anterior) (front) branches must be preserved so the horse has feeling at the coronary band at the front of the foot on both sides of the midline.  Lack of feeling at the coronary band on the front of the foot is prima facie evidence that a horse has been nerved in contravention of this rule.  Incisions over nerves at or above the fetlock are evidence that the horse has been high nerved, even if partial or complete feeling is present at the front of the coronary band of the foot.  No "high nerving" (at or above the fetlock, including volar, palmar or plantar nerves) is permitted by any means:  surgical, physical, including but not limited to freezing (cryosurgery) or chemical, including but not limited to injection of alcohol.  The use or injection of snake venom as a chemical means of nerving is strictly prohibited.
