		<h3>21.06 <u>Trainer Held Responsible as the Absolute Insurer</u></h3>
		<p>A trainer shall be responsible at all times for the condition of all horses trained by him/her. No trainer shall start a horse or permit a horse in his/her custody to be started if he/she knows, or if by the exercise of reasonable care he/she might have known or have cause to believe, that the horse has received any drug, stimulant, depressant, sedative or other unapproved medication that could result in a positive test. Every trainer must guard or cause to be guarded each horse trained by him/her in such manner and for such period of time prior to racing the horse so as to prevent any person not employed by or connected with the owner or trainer from administering any drug, stimulant, sedative, depressant or other unapproved medication that might result in a post-race positive test. Whenever a trainer of a horse names a substitute trainer for program purposes due to his/her inability to be in attendance with the horse on the day of the race or for any other reason both trainers shall be responsible for the condition of the horse should the horse test positive. For the purpose of this section, the trainer of record (programmed trainer) shall be any individual who receives any compensation for training the horse.</p>
