		<h3>23.04 <u>Appeals</u></h3>
		<p>All decisions and rulings of the judges of any race, at non pari-mutuel track members may be appealed to the District Board of Review within 10 days after the notice of such decision or ruling. The appeal may be taken upon any question in the conduct of a race, interpretation of the Rules, decisions relative to the outcome of a race, application of penalties or other action affecting owners, drivers or horses but it must be based on a specific charge which if true would warrant modification or reversal of the decision. In order to take an appeal under Rule 18.01 a driver must have first made a complaint, claim or objection as required in Rule 18.02. The District Board of Review may vacate, modify or increase any penalty imposed by the judges and appealed to the District Board of Review.  
</p>
		<p>In multiple heat racing where heats of the same race are raced on the same day or where there is no opportunity for review of the matter an appeal of the judges' decision relative to the official placings based upon an alleged violation of Rule 18 or other rule shall not represent a stay of such official placings in order to qualify a horse or driver for any subsequent heat of the race. </p>
