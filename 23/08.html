		<h3>23.08 <u>Request for Stay of Penalty</u></h3>
		<p>In every case where a penalty is imposed and the penalty has been appealed to any appropriate appellate body, the appeal if requested shall stay imposition of the penalty until a hearing has been held and the merits of the appeal ruled upon. The stay will begin when the person appealing files in writing with the notice of appeal a request for a stay with the presiding judge such notice to be filed within 48 hours after the posting of the decision or penalty from which the appeal is taken. Notice shall be sworn to and shall state the grounds of the appeal. Security of $100.00 or an amount equal to the fine, if greater than $100.00 shall be posted with the filing of the notice of appeal and the request for stay. Upon final disposition of the appeal the security posted will be first applied to the monetary penalty imposed if any and the balance returned to the person appealing. Failure of the appellant to pursue the appeal shall result in a forfeiture of the security.</p>
