			<h3>24.06 Race Winner</h3>
			<p>A horse shall be deemed the winner of a race as soon as the judges have determined the official placings and the "official" sign has been posted. Pari-mutuel pools shall be distributed according to the official placings. Purse money shall be awarded according to the final official placings, recognizing that the original official placings by the judges may be changed or revised by the judges or other Review Board due to an appeal, protest, positive test or other finding.</p>
			<p>Races and/or purse money awarded to a horse after the official sign has been posted shall be considered a winning performance.  The horse placed first shall no longer be considered a maiden, and the horse placed first by virtue of a disqualification shall acquire a win-race record only if such horses' actual time can be determined by photo finish or electronic timing in accordance with the provisions of Rule 24.03.  The horse that finished first and subsequently placed shall revert back to its status as a maiden. </p>
