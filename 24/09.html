		<h3>24.09 <u>Time Performances</u></h3>
		<p>Time trial performances are permitted subject to the following:
</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p>(a)	A Urine and/or blood tests are required for all horses starting for a time performance. The provisions of Rule 21, with the exception of Rule 21.04 relative to stimulants and drugs shall apply to time trial performances and a violation of any section of that rule shall result in a disallowance of the time trial performance. In addition further penalties may be imposed under the provisions of Rule 21.10.
		    <br />
		    (b)	An approved electric timer is required for all time performances. In the event of a failure of a timer during the progress of a time performance no time trial performance record will be obtained.
		    <br />
		    (c)	Time trial performances may be permitted immediately prior to or following a regularly scheduled meeting provided a full complement of licensed officials is in the judges' stand. 
		    <br />
		    (d)	Time trial performances are limited for two-year-olds who go to equal or to beat 2:10 and three-year-olds and over who go to equal or beat 2:05.
		    <br />
		    (e)	In any race or performance against time excessive use of the whip shall be considered a violation.
		    <br />
		    (f)	Time trial performance records shall not be included in the performance lines in a race program.
		    <br />
		    (g)	Time trial performances shall be designated by preceding the time with two capital T's.
		    <br />
		    (h)	When a horse performs against time it shall be proper to allow another horse or horses to accompany him in the performance but not to precede or to be harnessed with or in any way attached to him.  No horse may be used as a prompter for more than two time trial performances each time he is hitched, and no prompter may be hitched more than three times in a single day with at least 40 minutes between each such use. It shall be the responsibility of the presiding judge to see that prompters are not abused.
		    <br />
		    (i)	A break during a time trial is a losing effort and a losing performance shall not constitute a record.
		    <br />
		    (j)	If there is a failure or malfunction of the electric timing device and it is discovered prior to the completion of the first half-mile of the trial there shall be a recall and it is the responsibility of the tracks sponsoring time performances to provide a signal plainly visible and distinguishable to the driver at or near the quarter and half-mile poles which shall be flashed when a recall is in order.
