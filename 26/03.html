		<h3>26.03 <u>Non-Standardbred</u></h3>
		<p>Any horse may be registered as Non-Standardbred upon filing application showing satisfactory identification of the horse. This identification may be accomplished by furnishing the name, age, sex, sire, dam, color and markings and history of the previous owners. A mating certificate must accompany this application showing the sire to be some type of a registered horse. Any owner standing a Non-Standardbred stallion for service must include the fact that it is Non- Standardbred in all advertisements of such service.
</p>
		<p>Other provisions of these rules notwithstanding, the Registration Committee may register as Non-Standardbred any horse which does not qualify for such registration under this section if in their opinion such horse should be registered Non-Standardbred. </p>
