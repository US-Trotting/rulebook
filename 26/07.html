		<h3>26.07 <u>Breeding Requirements</u></h3>
		<p>It shall be the responsibility of stallion owners to have each stallion properly DNA genotyped at a USTA approved laboratory.  Failure to comply with this requirement may subject the stallion owner or lessee of a stallion to suspension and/or a fine not to exceed $5,000.00, and applications for registration may be refused from any person not complying with this requirement.
</p>
		<p>Stallion owners shall keep a stallion record showing the mare's name, sire and dam, color, markings, owner, breeding dates, and color, sex and foaling date of any foals born on the stallion owner's premises. The records shall be available for inspection by Officers or authorized representatives of the USTA, and shall be kept at least 10 years or filed with the USTA.
	  </p>
		<p>All persons standing a stallion at either public or private service shall file with the USTA a list of all mares bred to each stallion together with the dates of service. This list must be filed by September 1st of the year of breeding. Failure to comply with this provision may subject the owner or lessee of the stallion to a fine of not less than $10.00 or more than $50.00. Application for registration may be refused from any person not complying with this rule. 
	  </p>
	  <p>All brood mares must be blood typed or DNA genotyped at a USTA-approved laboratory.</p>
		<p> The total mares bred to a stallion standing in the United States that has never bred a mare or had a list of mares bred filed previously shall not exceed 140. 
	  </p>
		<p>These limits on total mares bred may only be exceeded in the event of death of a mare which has been bred in which case a new mare may be added to the mares bred list and bred to the stallion.  In any such extraordinary circumstances a signed certificate from a licensed veterinarian, which the Registration Committee may require to be notarized; verifying the death of the mare must be submitted to the Registration Committee.  The Registration Committee shall have the sole authority to determine if such extraordinary circumstances did in fact exist.  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances approved by the Registration Committee, each mare bred in excess of the above limits shall constitute a separate violation of this section and for each violation a fine in the amount of twice the pertinent stud fee or $25,000.00, whichever is greater shall be applicable to the violating stallion syndicate, syndicate manager, stallion owner or stallion manager as the Registration Committee may determine.
