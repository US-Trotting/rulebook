          <br />
          (c)	Names of outstanding horses may not be used again nor may they be used as a prefix or suffix unless the name is a part of the name of the sire or dam. A prefix or a suffix such as "Junior", etc., is not acceptable.

<br />
(i)	Horses may be named by January 1st, subsequent to their foaling without penalty.
