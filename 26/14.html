		<h3>26.14 <u>Penalty for Executing False Application for Registration or Transfer</u></h3>
	The  President, Executive Vice-President, Registration Committee or District Board  of Review may summon persons who have executed applications for registration or  transfer or alterations of registration certificates that have become subject  to question as well as any other person who may have knowledge thereof. Failure  to respond to such summons may be punished by a fine, suspension, or expulsion.  If the investigation reveals that an application for registration or transfer  contains false or misleading information, the person or persons responsible may  be fined, suspended, or expelled and in addition may be barred from further  registration or transfer of horses in USTA records and such animal may be barred from  registration. The decision of the President, Executive Vice-President,  Registration Committee, or District Board of Review, as the case may be, shall  be reduced to writing and shall be final unless the person or persons aggrieved  thereby shall, within 10 days, appeal   provided in Article IX of the Bylaws. </div>
