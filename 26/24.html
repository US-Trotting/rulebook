		<h3>26.24 <u>Embryo Transfer</u></h3>
	  <p>Any successful embryo flush of a mare and subsequent transfer to a recipient mare shall be reported to the Registrar within 35 days of the transfer.  No horse that is conceived by embryo or ovum transfer or by artificial insemination not meeting the requirements or restrictions as set forth in Rule 26.24(d)(5) below shall be registered with USTA.</p>
	  <p>A foal that results from an embryo/ovum transfer shall be eligible for registration only if the following requirements are met:
	    <br />
	    (a)	Prior to the embryo/ovum transfer, application is made to the Registrar setting out sufficient details for the Registrar to determine whether the proposed transfer complies with the Rules and the Registrar approves the embryo/ovum transfer. Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a $5,000.00 penalty fee which shall be in addition to the fee for registration set forth in Rule 27.04. <br />
	    (b)	Only a donor mare's first born embryo/ovum transfer foal each year will be eligible for registration;
	    <br />
	    (c)	The donor mare is at least 2 years of age or older at the time of the embryo/ovum transfer.<br />
(d)	All other normal registration requirements are met.</p>
	  <p>A foal that results from an embryo/ovum transfer may be registered provided that: <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	An application is submitted to the Registrar on the USTA&#39;s
prescribed form and is accompanied by the prescribed fee.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	The stallion and donor mare are blood typed or DNA tested.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	The Registrar approves the embryo/ovum transfer by letter sent to the applicant.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.	Subsequent to all embryo/ovum transfers a "Certificate of Embryo/Ovum Transfer" is completed on the USTA's prescribed form and filed with the Registrar within 35 days following each embryo/ovum transfer. 
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.	The application for registration and the mating certificate are on file with the USTA, and the registration fee is paid no later than December 31st of the horse's yearling year.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.	Registration fees, in accordance with the present fee schedule, are paid.
        <br />
        (e)	For purposes of USTA registration, an embryo/ovum transfer foal shall be considered to be the property of the owner of the donor mare at the time of mating.
	    <br />
	    (f)	A donor mare shall not be exported or be eligible to race in claiming races during the donee mare's gestation period.
	    <br />
	    (g)	A foal resulting from a frozen embryo/ovum transfer shall not be eligible for registration.
	    <br />
	    (h)	Any successful embryo flush of a donor mare and subsequent implant in a recipient mare shall be reported to the Registrar within 21 days of the implant.	    </p>
	  <p>A maximum of one embryo per donor mare will be permitted to be transferred to a recipient mare per heat-cycle of the donor mare regardless of the number of embryos successfully recovered. Pregnancy in the recipient mare terminates the embryo collection process for the donor mare and also terminates the breeding of the donor mare for the duration of the same breeding season unless the recipient mare is subsequently determined not to be pregnant in which case the transfer process may be reinitiated. Person having responsibility for the relevant breeding records must keep records adequate to enable the USTA to verify compliance with this requirement.  Thus a foal that results from an embryo/ovum transfer may be registered with the USTA provided that an application is submitted to the Registrar on the prescribed form and is accompanied by the prescribed fee of $25.00. </p>
	  <p>Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a $1,000.00 penalty fee which shall be in addition to the fee for registration set forth in Rule 27.04. </p>
