		<h3>5.02 Hippodroming Ban.</h1>
		<p>
			All races conducted by member tracks shall be bona fide contests with the winner receiving the largest share of the purse and the balance of the purse distribution made according to the order of finish as provided in these Rules. No hippodroming or other arrangement for equal distribution of the purse money among the contestants is permitted with the exception of non-pari-mutuel races which are either amateur races or promotional races, and the winner of such a race shall not be credited with a win race record.  Violation of this rule will subject the track member, officials in charge and the owners and drivers to fine, suspension or expulsion.
