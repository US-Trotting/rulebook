				<li>(b) Determine all questions of fact relating to the race.</li>
				<li>(c) Decide any differences between parties to the race, or any contingent matter which shall arise, such as are not otherwise provided for in these Rules.</li>
				<li>(d) Declare pools and bets “off” in case of fraud, no appeal to be allowed from their decision in that respect. All pools and bets follow the decision of the judges. Such a decision in respect to pools and bets shall be made at the conclusion of the race upon the observations of the judges and upon such facts as an immediate investigation may <s>shall</s> develop. A reversal or change of decision after the official placing at the conclusion of the <s>heat or dash</s> <strong>heat or race </strong> shall not affect the distribution of betting pools made upon such official placing. <s>When pools and bets are declared off for fraud, the guilty parties shall be fined, suspended or expelled.</s></li>

In no case shall there be any compromise or change on the part of the judges <s>or members</s> of punishment prescribed in the Rules, but the same shall be strictly enforced. <strong>Track </strong>members shall not remove or modify any fine imposed by the judges of a race, review any order of suspension, expulsion or interfere with the judges performing their duties.</li>
				<li>(f) Examine <s>under oath</s> all parties connected with a race as to any wrong or complaint. Any person required to appear before the judges for a hearing or examination who shall fail to appear after due notice in writing shall be penalized. <s>as provided in (e) above.</s></li>
				<li>(g) Consider complaints of foul from the <s>patrols,</s> owners, <strong>trainers </strong>or drivers in the race and no others.</li>
