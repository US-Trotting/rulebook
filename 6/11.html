		<h3>6.11 <u>Duties of the Judges.</u></h3>
		<p>
			It shall be the duty of the judges to:
			<ul style="list-style:none;">
				<li>(a) Exclude from the race any horse that in their opinion is improperly equipped, dangerous, or unfit to race which shall include sick, weak, and extremely lame horses. No horse shall race with a tube in its throat. No horse shall be permitted to wear a head pole that protruding beyond its nose.  No horse may race unless he has unimpaired vision in one eye and no horse infected with equine infectious anemia, or a carrier thereof, shall race.</li>
				<li>(b) Investigate any apparent or possible interference, or other violation of Rule 18.01, by posting the "inquiry" sign whether or not a complaint has been made by the driver.</li>
				<li>(c) Investigate any act of cruelty seen by them or reported to them towards a race horse during a meeting at which they officiate. If the Judges find that such an act has been committed they shall suspend or fine the offending person and submit a written report within 10 days of their findings and action to the Executive Vice-President. The Executive Vice-President shall have all the authority conferred upon the judges by this section, and in addition may order an investigation and hearing and impose a penalty for any act of cruelty or neglect of a horse committed by any person whether on or off the premises of any racetrack.</li>
				<li>(d) Conduct an investigation of any accidents to determine the cause thereof, and the judges shall completely fill out an accident report and mail to the USTA office. In connection with the investigation of an accident the judges shall have the authority to require any driver or other person involved in the accident to submit to testing for the personal use of alcohol and/or drugs.</li>
				<li>(e) Observe closely performance of the drivers and the horses to ascertain if there are any violations of Rule 18; particularly, interference, helping, or inconsistent racing and exhaust all means possible to safeguard the contestants and the public.</li>
				<li>(f)	Grant a hearing at a designated time before a penalty may be imposed upon any party. All three Judges should be present if possible, and at least the presiding judge and one associate judge must be present at all judges&#39; hearings. The judges may impose the penalties prescribed by these Rules. It shall be the duty of the judges to notify the party of a hearing as soon as possible, but in any event, where there is an alleged driving violation, said notice shall be furnished no later than 12:00 noon the day following the race.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event the judges believe that a person has committed a rule violation and has left the grounds and they are unable to contact him and hold a hearing thereon they may make an investigation and send a detailed written report to the Executive Vice-President of the USTA. The Executive Vice- President may impose a penalty not to exceed 10 days without a hearing based upon the report of the Judges.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any person charged with a rule violation shall be given at least until 12:00 noon of the following day to prepare his defense if he so requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			All penalty notices will carry the exact reason why the penalty has been imposed together with the rule violated.
		</p>
		<ul style="list-style:none;">
			<li>(g)	Declare a heat or race "no contest" in the event the racetrack is thrown into darkness during the progress of a race by failure of electricity or other situation if the judges deem it is in the best interest of racing.</li>
