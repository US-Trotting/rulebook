		<h1>6.16 <u>Timers.</u></h1>
		<p>
			At each race there shall be three timers in the judges&#39; or timers&#39; stand except when an electric timing device is used, in which event there shall be one timer.  All times shall be announced and recorded in fifths of seconds. An approved electronic or electric timing device must be used where horses are started from a chute.
		</p>
		<p>
			The timers shall be in the stand 15 minutes before the first race is to be contested. They shall start their watches when the first horse leaves the point from which the distance of the race is measured. The time of the leading horse at the quarter, half, three-quarters, and the finish shall be taken. If odd distances are raced the fractions shall be noted accordingly.
