			<h3>12.01 Duties and Responsibilities of Directors and Officers.</h3>
			<strong class="2019">
			<p>
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
					<li>Directors and officers of the association have a fiduciary responsibility to the association and to the Standardbred breeding and racing industry as a whole. That responsibility consists of the duty to exercise his or her decision-making powers in good faith and in a manner that the individual reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the association and the industry. Although the director or officer should be aware of the consensus of opinion on an issue of the association members that he or she represents, the director's or officer's ultimate duty is to the association and the industry, even if an action or decision is contrary to an individual's personal interests.</li>
					<li>An individual should not seek or consent to become a director unless he or she is willing to devote sufficient time and attention to the job. That includes familiarity with the personnel and programs of the association and the careful and timely review of materials in order to be informed about the issues that are then under consideration. Each director should also be prepared and willing to communicate with the members in his or her district about those issues.</li>
					<li>Directors and officers must consistently attend the annual district meetings in their districts and the annual meetings of the association. Directors and officers are also expected to prepare for meetings by reviewing the meeting agenda and materials in advance. Regardless of extenuating circumstances, if a director or officer (i) fails to attend or otherwise participate in three (3) or more consecutive annual district meetings in his or her district or (ii) fails to attend three (3) or more consecutive annual meetings of the association, he or she shall be automatically removed from office. Directors and officers may participate in a district meeting through a telephone, video conference or similar connection that permits instantaneous communication with other attendees.</li>
					<li>Unless and until internal discussions and materials are made public, directors and officers shall protect the confidentiality of all such discussions and materials.</li>
