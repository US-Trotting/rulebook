			<h3>12.02 Conflicts of Interest.</h3>
			<strong class="2019">
			<p>
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
					<li>Any director or officer of the association who has a direct or indirect “financial interest” is deemed to be an “interested person.” An interested person consists of the director or officer and his or her spouse, parent or child, or a business entity in which the director or officer or the spouse, parent or child holds a significant ownership interest. A financial interest consists of an existing transaction or arrangement with the association or one that is under negotiation, or a compensation arrangement with the association, other than transactions or arrangements that are generally and uniformly available to all association members or to one or more categories of association members. Any interested person who has a direct or indirect financial interest is deemed to have a conflict of interest under these bylaws.</li>
					<li>In the event of such an actual or potential conflict of interest, the interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest in writing to the president of the association. Upon making that disclosure, the interested person shall be afforded the opportunity to describe all material facts relating to the financial interest to the board and to any committee that is considering the transaction or arrangement. Following that disclosure, the interested person shall, at the request of the president or the chairman of the committee, leave the room to allow a free discussion of the matter. The interested person shall also refrain from voting on the matter. However, the existence of a conflict of interest shall not prevent the board or the committee from voting to enter into the financial interest with the interested person.</li>
					<li>If it is determined that an interested person has failed to disclose a conflict of interest, the interested person shall be subject to disciplinary or corrective action by the board or by a committee designated by the board, at their discretion. Such action may include, without limitation, the reprimanding or removal from office of the interested person and the rescission of the transaction or arrangement between the interested person and the association.</li>
					<li>The board may, in its discretion, require some or all of the association's directors and officers to periodically sign a written statement confirming their understanding and acceptance of the association's conflict of interest policy.</li>
