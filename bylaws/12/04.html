			<h3>12.04 Whistleblower Policy.</h3>
			<strong class="2019">
			<p>
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
          <li>In order to promote openness, honesty, integrity and ethical conduct by directors, officers, agents and employees of the association in their administration of the business of the association and their dealings with the association, its members and each other, the association strongly encourages the disclosure of information about any conduct that pertains to association matters and is illegal, unethical, fraudulent, or contrary to the policies of the association, or concerns financial discrepancies. The goal is to discourage conduct that may damage the interests and reputation of the association and its ability to be a positive influence on the Standardbred breeding and racing industry. This is intended to supplement and not replace the usual personnel policies and operating procedures of the association.</li>
          <li>Complaints or information regarding illegal, fraudulent, dishonest or other unethical conduct or financial discrepancies that is not appropriate for handling through the association's normal administrative procedures should be reported in writing, with or without identifying the reporting person, to the president or executive vice president. Verbal contact alone is discouraged. Although a reporting person is not expected to prove the truth of an allegation, the reporting person needs to demonstrate reasonable grounds for the report. Persons who make allegations with intentional or reckless disregard for their truth or falsity may be subject to disciplinary action by the association. However, if the allegation is made in good faith and with a reasonable belief that the allegation is true, the reporting person will be protected from retaliation, harassment and adverse employment consequences. Any attempted retaliation or harassment will be treated as an act of abuse or harassment under ยง12.03.</li>
          <li>After receiving such an allegation, the president or executive vice president will make or direct initial inquiries to determine if a full investigation is warranted. Any full investigation will be undertaken by a standing committee designated by or a special committee appointed by the president. The committee will provide the board with a report summarizing the allegation and the findings of the investigation, and recommend actions to be taken in response, if any. While anonymous allegations will be received, special consideration in their investigation will be given to the seriousness of the allegation, the credibility of the person who is the subject of the allegation, and the likelihood of confirming the allegation in the absence of a complaining witness.</li>
