			<h3>4.05 Election of Track Directors</h3>

				Any candidate for the position of pari-mutuel track director must be an individual member of this association, and upon election, must maintain that membership throughout the term of office. Track directors shall be nominated and elected by the extended pari-mutuel tracks in each qualifying district as follows: 
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
					<li><strong>Notice of Election.</strong> - Notice of the election shall be sent to the track to include a breakdown of the number of available votes to be cast by each track member eligible to vote in the election along with a proxy form, calling for the election of the track members at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the election. Such election shall take place at any time prior to the time of the annual district meeting.</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Calculation of Votes.</strong> - Pari-mutuel track members shall be entitled to cast votes on a proportional basis determined in direct relation to total net purses paid by track members in each district during the previous calendar year. The number of votes to be cast shall be determined as follows:
						<ol>
							<li>Net purses less than $250,000 - 1 vote</li>
							<li>Net purses amounting to between $250,001 and $500,000 - 2 votes</li>
							<li>Net purses amounting to between $500,001 and $1,500,000 - 4 votes</li>
							<li>Net purses amounting to between $1,500,001 and $3,000,000 - 6 votes</li>
							<li>Net purses amounting to between $3,000,001 and $5,000,000 - 8 votes</li>
							<li>Net purses amounting to $5,000,001 and over - 10 votes.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Nominations.</strong> - Nominations for pari-mutuel track directors shall be made by pari-mutuel track members of each district.</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Casting of Votes.</strong> - The votes on behalf of any pari-mutuel track member shall be cast by the president thereof or his proxy. Partnerships operating tracks will by resolution designate the person authorized to cast the ballots for such member.
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Voting by Proxy.</strong> - In the event the president of the pari-mutuel track member chooses to authorize another person to cast the votes, a proxy signed by the president must be filed with the USTA office prior to or at the time of the casting of votes.</li>
							<li><strong>Voting for more than One Candidate.</strong> - When all pari-mutuel track directors subject to nomination by the pari-mutuel tracks in any one district are to be nominated the same year, each track may cast all its votes for one director or may divide its votes among various directors to be nominated.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Term of Office.</strong> - The terms of office for a track director shall be three (3) years.</li>
					<li><strong>Election Results.</strong> - The candidate receiving the highest number of votes for each vacancy shall be deemed to be elected to the pari-mutuel track directorships of that district.</li>
					<li><strong>Limit of Representation.</strong> - With the exception of district 8A, pari-mutuel track members shall be limited to one representative on the Board of Directors.</li>
