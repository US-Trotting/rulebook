			<h3>1.03 Denial of Membership - Racing Commission License Granted</h3>
			<p>
				In the event that USTA denies membership to an individual or defers a decision beyond 30 days pending further investigation to determine if he/she meets the requirements of the Bylaws relative to membership; and in the event a state racing authority determines that such person fully meets its requirements and licenses such person to participate at meetings under the jurisdiction of such racing authority, the USTA will issue electronic eligibility and/or driver/trainer licenses limited to such meetings and keep performance records on such person and his/her horses while racing at such meetings in the same manner and for the same fee as for members. Licenses and/or electronic eligibility issued pursuant to this rule and section shall also be valid at county fairs and other meetings within the geographical boundaries of those states whose racing authorities have licensed said individual.
