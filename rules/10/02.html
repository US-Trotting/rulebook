			<h3>10.02 Types of Races to be Offered</h3>
			<p>
				The racing secretary shall use exclusively the following types of races:
				<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
					<li>Stakes and futurities.</li>
					<li>Early closing and late closing events.</li>
					<li>Conditioned races.  Such qualifications may be based upon, among other things:
						<ol>
							<li>Horse's money winnings in a specified number of precious races or during a specified previous time.</li>
							<li>A horse's finishing position in a specified number of previous races or during a specified period of time.</li>
							<li>Age. </li>
							<li>Sex.  </li>
							<li>Number of starts during a specified period of time.</li>
							<li>Special qualifications for foreign horses that do not have a representative number of starts in the United States or Canada.</li>
							<li>Or any one or more combinations of the qualifications herein listed.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Claiming races.</li>
					<li>Preferred races limited to the fastest horses at the meeting. 
						<ol>
							<li>These may be free-for-all races, JFA, or invitational. Horses to be used in such races shall be posted in the race secretary's office and listed with the presiding judge. Horses so listed shall not be eligible for conditioned overnight races unless the conditions specifically include horses on the preferred list. Twelve such races may be conducted during a 6 day period of racing at tracks distributing more than $100,000.00 in overnight purses during such period and not more than ten such races shall be conducted at other tracks during a 6 day period of racing, provided that at least two of these races are for three-year-olds, four-year-olds, or combined three and four-year-olds. </li>
							<li>At tracks which race less than 5 days per week, not more than ten such races may be conducted during a 6 day period. Purses offered for such races shall be at least 15&#37; higher than the highest purse offered for a conditioned race programmed the same racing week.  </li>
							<li>No two-year-old or three-year-old will be eligible to be placed on the preferred or invitational list to race against older horses until it has won seven races unless requested by the owner or authorized agent. The owner or authorized agent may withdraw such request at his discretion.</li>
							<li>Where a meeting is in progress in December and continues in January of the subsequent year, races and earnings won at that meeting may be computed in determining whether a horse may be placed on the preferred list.</li>
