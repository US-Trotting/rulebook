			<h3>11.03 Claiming Procedure. </h3>
			<p>
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Claimant's Credit. - The claimant must have to his credit with the track member giving the race an amount equivalent to the specified claiming price plus the requisite fees for the transfer of ownership.</li>
					<li>Claiming Procedure and Determination of Claiming Price.  - The trainer or authorized agent entering a horse in a claiming race warrants that he/she has authorization from the registered owner(s) to enter said horse in a claiming race for the designated amount. In the event of a claim the owner(s) or authorized agent shall submit a signed registration certificate or in the case of a paperless certificate the signed application for transfer form to the judges prior to receiving proceeds from the claim.  The presiding judge shall immediately forward to the USTA the signed registration certificate or application for transfer form to the Registrar for transfer.</li> 
					<li>Claiming Price On Program.  - The basic claiming price for which each horse is entered shall be printed on the program, but all claims shall be for the adjusted price after the prescribed allowances made for sex and/or age have been added to the basic price.</li>
					<li>
						Execution of Claim.  - 
						<ol>
							<li>Claim Box. - All claims shall be in writing, sealed and deposited at least 15 minutes before the time originally scheduled for the race to begin, in a locked box provided for this purpose by the track member.
							<li>Opening of Claim Box. - The claim box shall be opened and the claim, if any, examined by the judges.
							<li>Multiple Claims on Same Horses. - Should more than one claim be filed for the same horse, the owner shall be determined by lot by the judges.
							<li>Delivery of Claimed Horse.  - A horse claimed shall be delivered immediately by the original owner or his trainer to the successful claimant upon authorization of the presiding judge. The horse's halter must accompany the horse. Altering or removing the horse's shoes will be considered a violation of this rule.
							<li>	Refusal to Deliver Claimed Horse. - Any person who refuses to deliver a horse legally claimed out of a claiming race shall be suspended together with the horse until delivery is made.
							<li>	Vesting of Title to Claimed Horse. - Every horse claimed shall race in all heats of the event in the interest and for the account of the owner who declared it in the event, but title to the claimed horse shall be vested in the successful claimant from the time the word "go" is given in the first heat, and said successful claimant shall become the owner of the horse, whether it be alive or dead or sound or unsound, or injured during the race or after it, provided however that the final vesting of title to a claimed horse is subject to the conditions and provisions of Rule 10.11.
							<li>Affidavit by Claimant. - The judges shall require any person making a claim for a horse to make affidavit that he is claiming said horse for his own account or as authorized agent and not for any other person. Any person making such affidavit willfully and falsely shall be subject to punishment as hereinafter provided.
							<li>Penalty for Thirty Days. - If a horse is claimed no right, title or interest therein shall be sold or transferred except in a claiming race for a period of 30 days following the date of claiming.
							<li>	Return of Claimed Horse to Previous Owner or Stable. - No horse claimed out of a claiming race shall be eligible to start in any race in the name or interest of the prior owner for 30 days nor shall such horse remain in the same stable or under the care or management of the prior owner or trainer, or anyone connected therewith unless reclaimed out of another claiming race.
							<li>Scratched Horse. - The successful claimant of a horse programmed to start may, at his option, acquire ownership of a claimed horse even though such claimed horse was scratched and did not start in the claiming race from which it was scratched. The successful claimant must exercise his option by 9:00 a.m. of the day following the claiming race to which the horse was programmed and scratched. Programmed to start shall be defined as appearing in the printed official racing program. No horse may be claimed from a claiming race unless the race is contested.
							<li>Blood Sample Procedure if Horse is Claimed. - In the event a horse is claimed a blood sample shall be taken by a licensed veterinarian and the sample identified as being from a claimed horse shall be forwarded within 24 hours to an approved laboratory to be tested for equine infectious anemia. Pending the receipt of a negative test for equine infectious anemia the monies paid for the claimed horse shall be held by the track member. In the event of a positive test for equine infectious anemia the ownership of the claimed horse shall revert to the owner from whom the horse was claimed and the claiming monies shall be returned to the person or persons who claimed the horse. The cost of the test is to be borne by the claimant and the test may be waived by the claimant at his discretion by so indicating on the claiming slip.</li>
