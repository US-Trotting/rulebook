			<h3>12.19 Events Raced Under the Three Heat Plan.</h3>
			<p>
				Whenever elimination heats are required or specified in the published conditions of a stake or futurity such race may be raced on the three heat plan irrespective of any provisions in the conditions to the contrary. That is, the field shall be divided by lot and the first division shall race for 30% of the purse, the second division shall race for 30%, and the horses''' qualifying in the first and second divisions shall race the third heat for 30% of the purse. If after the third heat, no horse has won two heats, a fourth heat shall be raced by only the heat winners. The race winner shall receive the remaining 10% of the purse. The number of horses qualifying to return after each elimination heat will be the same as set out in Rule 12.18(a).
