			<h3>14.10 Preference Date. </h3>
			<p>
				Preference dates shall be given to horses in all overnight events at extended pari-mutuel tracks in accordance with the following:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>The date of the horse's last previous start in a purse race during the current year is his preference date with the following exceptions:
						<ol>
							<li>The preference date on a horse that has drawn to race and has been scratched is the date of the race from which scratched.
							<li>When a horse is racing for the first time in the current year the date of a successful qualifying attempt shall be considered his preference date.
							<li>Wherever horses have equal preference in a race the actual preference of said horses in relation to one another shall be determined from the most recent previous starts which do not result in equal preference.
							<li>When an overnight race has been re-opened because it did not fill all eligible horses declared into the race prior to the re-opening shall receive preference over other horses subsequently declared irrespective of the actual preference dates.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>This rule relative to preference is not applicable at any meeting at which an agricultural fair is in progress. All horses granted stalls and eligible must be given an opportunity to compete at these meetings.</li>
					<li>Nothing in this rule shall preclude an extended pari-mutuel track member from adopting a racetrack rule limiting an owner or trainer to one starter in any single overnight event.</li>
