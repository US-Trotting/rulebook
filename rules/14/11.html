			<h3>14.11 Qualifying Races. </h3>
			<p>
				At all extended pari-mutuel meetings entries for overnight events shall be governed by the following:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Within 30 days of being entered a horse that has not raced previously at the gait chosen must go a qualifying race under the supervision of a judge holding a presiding or associate judge's license for extended pari-mutuel meetings and acquire at least one charted line by a licensed charter. In order to provide complete and accurate chart information on time and beaten lengths a standard photo-finish shall be in use.</li>
					<li>A horse that does not show a charted line for the previous season or a charted line within its last six starts must go a qualifying race as set forth in (a). </li>
					<li>The judges may require any horse that has been on the steward's list to go a qualifying race. If a horse has raced in individual time not meeting the qualifying standards for that class of horse, he may be required to go a qualifying race.</li>
					<li>The judges may permit a horse to qualify by means of a timed workout consistent with the time of the races in which he will compete in the event adequate competition is not available for a qualifying race.</li>
					<li>To enable a horse to qualify qualifying races should be held at least one (1) full week prior to the opening of any meeting that opens before July 1st of a season and shall be scheduled at least twice a week. Qualifying races shall also be scheduled twice a week during the meeting unless otherwise agreed upon by the track member and representative horsemen's association. </li>
					<li>Where a race is conducted for the purpose of qualifying drivers and not horses the race need not be charted, timed or recorded. This section is not applicable to races qualifying both drivers and horses.</li>
					<li>If a horse takes a win race record in a qualifying race or a matinee race such record must be prefaced with the letter &ldquo;Q&rdquo; wherever it appears, except in a case where immediately prior to or following the race the horse taking the record has been submitted to an approved urine, or blood test.</li>
