			<h3>14.15 Coupled Entries</h3>
			<p>When the starters in a race include two or more horses owned or trained by the same person, or trained in the same stable or by the same management, they shall be &ldquo;coupled&rdquo; as an entry and a wager on one horse in the &ldquo;entry&rdquo; shall be a wager on all horses in the &ldquo;entry.&rdquo; Provided however that when a trainer enters two or more horses in a stake, early closing futurity, free-for-all or other special events under bona fide separate ownerships the said horses may with the approval of the racing authority be permitted to race as separate betting entries. The fact that such horses are trained by the same person shall be indicated prominently in the program. If the race is split in two or more divisions horses in an &ldquo;entry&rdquo; shall be seeded insofar as possible, first by owners, then by trainers, then by stables but the divisions in which they compete and their post positions shall be drawn by lot. The above provisions shall also apply to elimination heats.</p>
	        <p>At all meetings the person making the declaration of a horse that qualifies as a coupled entry with another horse entered in the same event shall be responsible to designate the word &ldquo;entry&rdquo; on the declaration blank.</p>
			<p>The presiding judge shall be responsible for coupling horses. In addition to the foregoing, horses separately owned or trained may be coupled as an entry where it is necessary to do so to protect the public interest for the purpose of pari-mutuel wagering only. However where this is done entries may not be rejected. Provided further that when a driver participates in a non-pari-mutuel purse race in which he/she has an ownership interest or trainer interest in one or more horses he/she must drive one of the horses in which he/she has an ownership interest or trainer interest.</p>
