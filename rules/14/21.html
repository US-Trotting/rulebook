			<h3>14.21 Horses Omitted Through Error.  </h3>
			<p>Such drawings shall be final unless there is conclusive evidence that a horse properly declared was omitted from the race through the error of a track member or its agent or employee in which event the horse shall be added to the race but given the last post position, provided the error is discovered prior to scratch time or the printing of the program whichever is sooner. However in the case of early closing events for more than $10,000.00 and stake and futurity events the race shall be re-drawn. This shall not apply at extended pari-mutuel meetings in overnight events.</p>
