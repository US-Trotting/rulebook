			<h3>16.09 Violations of the Starting Rule.  </h3>
			<p>
				A fine or suspension from driving may be applied to any driver by the starter and/or judges for:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Delaying the start.</li>
					<li>Failure to obey the starter's instruction.</li>
					<li>Rushing ahead of the inside or outside wing of the gate. </li>
					<li>Coming to the starting gate out of position. </li>
					<li>Crossing over before reaching the starting point. </li>
					<li>Interference with another driver during the start. </li>
					<li>Failure to come up into position.</li>
					<li>After coming to the gate, failure to keep one line in each hand until the word &ldquo;go,&rdquo; except for the purpose of adjusting equipment.</li>
				</ol>
				A hearing must be granted or waived before any penalty is imposed. A fine or suspension as a result of any of the above may be increased based upon the advertised purse amount, or if the violation is deemed to have been committed in order to aid another horse with common ownership or a common trainer. <i>(Effective 05/01/2019)</i>
