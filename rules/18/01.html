      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
       <li>	Change either to the right or left during any part of the race when another horse is so near him that in altering his position he compels the horse behind him to shorten his stride, or causes the driver of such other horse to pull him out of his stride.</li>
 <li>	Jostle, strike, hook wheels or interfere with another horse or driver.</li>
 <li>	Cross sharply in front of a horse or cross over in front of a field of horses in a reckless manner endangering other drivers.</li>

 <li>Crowd a horse or driver by &ldquo;putting a wheel under him.&rdquo; </li>
 <li>	Carry a horse out.</li>
 <li>	Sit down in front of a horse or take up abruptly in front of other horses so as to cause confusion or interference among trailing horses.</li>
 <li>	Let a horse pass inside needlessly or otherwise help another horse to improve his position in the race.</li>
 <li>	Commit any act which shall impede the progress of another horse or cause him to break.</li>
 <li>	Change course after selecting a position in the home stretch or swerve in an out or bear in and out in such a manner as to interfere with another horse or cause him to change course or take back.</li>
 <li>	To drive in a careless or reckless manner or fail to maintain reasonable control of the horse at all times during the race.</li>
