			<h3>18.01 Driving Violations.</h3>
			<p>
				<strong class="2019">At extended pari-mutuel tracks, a leading horse is not to be more than four feet from the inside rail/pylons</strong> except after selecting his position in the home stretch, neither the driver of the first horse nor any other driver in the race shall do any of the following things, any of which shall be considered a violation of driving rules:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Change either to the right or left during any part of the race when another horse is so near him that in altering his position he compels the horse behind him to shorten his stride, or causes the driver of such other horse to pull him out of his stride.</li>
					<li>Strike, hook wheels or <strong class="2019">physically</strong> interfere with another horse or driver, <strong class="2019">or otherwise drive in a careless manner or fail to maintain reasonable control of the horse at all times during the race. For any violation that results in contact with another horse, driver or bike, the driver shall receive a minimum driving suspension of three days.</strong></li>
					<li>Cross sharply in front of a horse or cross over in front of a field of horses in a reckless manner endangering other drivers.</li>
					<li>Swerve in and out or pull up quickly, <strong class="2019">unless such action is taken for the safety or welfare of the horse or driver.</strong></li>
					<li>Crowd a horse or driver by &ldquo;putting a wheel under him.&rdquo; </li>
					<li>Carry a horse out.</li>
					<li><strong class="2019">Slow</strong> down in front of a horse or take up abruptly in front of other horses so as to cause confusion or interference among trailing horses.</li>
					<li>Let a horse pass inside needlessly or otherwise help another horse to improve <strong class="2019">its position in the race by opening up a hole without then promptly pulling to re-pass the horse, unless the failure to re-pass is necessitated by safety reasons.</strong></li>
					<li>Commit any act which shall impede the progress of another horse or cause him to break.</li>
					<li>Change course after selecting a position in the home stretch or swerve in an out or bear in and out in such a manner as to interfere with another horse or cause him to change course or take back.</li>
					<li><strong class="2019">Kicking shall be defined as a blow or thrust with the foot against any part of the horse's body or to impel by striking with the foot at any time on the racetrack, including before, during or after the race. Removal of a foot from the stirrups or any foot supports in and of itself shall not constitute the offense of kicking. The penalty for kicking as defined herein shall not be less than nine days suspension.</strong></li>
					<li><strong class="2019">Foot Out of Stirrup.â€” It shall be considered a violation if a driver makes any contact with the horse while both feet are in or out of the stirrups or any foot supports. A driver shall be allowed to remove a foot from the stirrups or any foot supports temporarily for the purpose of pulling earplugs or to adjust equipment.</strong></li>
					<li>Cross the inside limits of the course.</li>
					<li><strong class="2019">Fail to make a reasonable effort to advance when pulling to the outside.</strong></li>
					<li><strong class="2019">Turn the horse abruptly after the finish line of the race in order to return to the paddock or barn area.</strong></li>
				</ol>
				<strong class="2019">If a violation of Rule 18 occurs during an extended pari-mutuel meeting and results in a suspension from driving, the suspension must be served by the driver during that meeting unless the appeal process carries beyond the end of the meeting, in which event the suspension must be served during the same time of year that a subsequent parimutuel meeting is being conducted at that race track.</strong> <i>(Effective 05/01/2019)</i>
