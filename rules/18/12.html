			<h3>18.12 Horse Breaking from Gait.</h3>
			<p>Horse Breaking from Gait. When a horse breaks from its programmed gait, the driver shall at once, where clearance exists, take such horse to the inside or outside and pull him to its gait.</p>
			<p>
				The following shall be considered violations:
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Failure to properly attempt to pull the horse to its gait. </li>
					<li>Failure to take to the inside or outside where clearance exists. </li>
					<li><strong>Failure to continuously lose ground while offstride.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Committing an extended break, in which the horse may be placed last.</strong></li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p><strong>If there has been no violation of (a), (b), (c), or (d) above, the horse shall not be set back unless a contending horse on its gait is lapped on the hind quarter of the breaking horse at the finish. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if interference caused by another driver or horse has caused the horse to be on a break at the finish, the judges may, in their discretion, determine not to set the horse back even if a contending horse on its gait is lapped on the hind quarter of the breaking horse at the finish. The judges may set any horse back one or more places if, in their judgment, any of the above violations has been committed and the driver may be subject to a fine or suspension or both.</strong> (Effective 05/1/2019)</p>
