		<h3>21.02 Collection of Test Sample / Split Sample</h3>
		<p>During the taking of the urine or other sample by the veterinarian, the owner, trainer or authorized agent may be present.  Samples so taken shall be placed in two containers and shall immediately be sealed and the evidence of such sealing indicated thereon by the signature of the representative of the owner or trainer. One part of the sample is to be placed in a depository under the supervision of the presiding judge and/or any other agency the racing authority may designate to be safeguarded until such time as the report on the chemical analysis of the other portion of the split sample is received.
</p>
		<p>Should a positive report be received, an owner or trainer shall have the right to have the other portion of the split sample inserted in with a subsequent group being sent for testing or may demand that it be sent to another chemist for analysis, the cost of which will be paid by the party requesting the test. </p>
