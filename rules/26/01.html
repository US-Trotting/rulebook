		<h3>26.01 Membership Requirements to Register Horse</h3>
		<p>In order to register a horse the owner thereof must be a USTA member.  In the case of a registered farm or stable owned by a limited partnership the requirement with respect to the registration of horses shall be met if all general partners of such partnership and the corresponding officer of such farm or stable are USTA members.  Any person authorized to sign a mating certificate, an application for registration or any of the required breeding or registration reports must be a USTA member.  Provided a foal is being put into the registered ownership of the breeder/registered owner of the mare, and the stud fee is paid, the foal may be registered without the owner of the mare's signature.  This does not apply where the ownership is changing. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Effective 05/01/2017)</span></p>
