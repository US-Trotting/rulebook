			<h3>26.03 Appendix/Non-Standardbred.</h3>
			<p>Any horse may be registered as Non-Standard <strong>providing one of the parents is a registered Standardbred. The following provisions must also be met:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li style="font-weight: bold;">If the sire is a Standardbred, the USTA must receive a list of mares bred (LOMB) with breeding dates for the mare and the resulting signed mating certificate; or if the dam is a Standardbred, the USTA must receive a signed mating certificate (or equivalent) from the stallion's registry.</li>
				<li style="font-weight: bold;">DNA markers and a copy of the registration papers must be sent to the USTA from the non-Standardbred parent's registry. If the non-Standardbred parent has not been previously DNA genotyped by their registry, a DNA kit may be ordered to satisfy the requirements.</li>
				<li style="font-weight: bold;">An application for foal registration must be filled out for the resulting foal and submitted with the appropriate registration fee.</li>
				<li style="font-weight: bold;">The owner of the Standardbred parent and the owner of the foal must be current USTA members.</li>
				<li style="font-weight: bold;">The foal must be DNA typed and permanently identified in accordance with Rule 26.27.</li>
			</ol>
			<p style="font-weight: bold;">Any owner standing a Non-Standard stallion for service must include the fact that it is Non-Standard in all advertisements of such service.</p>
			<p>Other provisions of these rules notwithstanding, the Registration Committee may register as Non-Standard any horse which does not qualify for such registration under this section if, in their opinion, such horse should be registered Non-Standard.</p>
			<p style="font-weight: bold;">A registered Non-Standard horse cannot race and the records of such horses will be kept separate from those registered as Standardbred.</p>
