			<h3>26.03 Non-Standardbred.</h3>
			<p>Any horse may be registered as Non-Standardbred upon filing application showing satisfactory identification of the horse.

A mating certificate must accompany this application showing the sire to be some type of a registered horse. Any owner standing a Non-Standardbred stallion for service must include the fact that it is Non- Standardbred in all advertisements of such service.</p>
			<p>Other provisions of these rules notwithstanding, the Registration Committee may register as Non-Standardbred any horse which does not qualify for such registration under this section if in their opinion such horse should be registered Non-Standardbred.</p>
