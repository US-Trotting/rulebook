			<h3>26.23 Embryo Transfer</h3>
	  		<p>A foal that results from an embryo/ovum transfer shall be eligible for registration only if the following requirements are met:</p>
	  		<ol>
	  			<li>The donor mare is at least two (2) years of age or older at the time of the embryo/ovum transfer.</li>
	  			<li>Prior to the embryo/ovum transfer, the Application for Embryo Transfer is completed and submitted with the application fee to the USTA and approved by the registrar. Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a penalty fee.</li>
	  			<li>Subsequent to all embryo/ovum transfers, a Certificate of Embryo Transfer is completed and filed with the registrar within thirty-five (35) days following each embryo/ovum transfer. Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a penalty fee.</li>
	  			<li>Only a donor mare's first-born embryo/ovum transfer foal each year will be eligible for registration. A maximum of one embryo per donor mare will be permitted to be transferred to a recipient mare per heat cycle of the donor mare regardless of the number of embryos successfully recovered. Pregnancy in the recipient mare terminates the embryo collection process for the donor mare and also terminates the breeding of the donor mare for the duration of the same breeding season unless the recipient mare is subsequently determined not to be pregnant in which case the transfer process may be reinitiated. The person having responsibility for the relevant breeding records must keep records adequate to enable the USTA to verify compliance with this requirement. Failure to comply with this requirement shall result in a penalty fee.</li>
	  			<li>A donor mare shall not be exported or be entered to race in claiming races during the recipient mare's gestation period.</li>
	  			<li>All other normal registration requirements are met.</li>
	  			<li>For purposes of USTA registration, an embryo/ovum transfer foal shall be considered to be the property of the owner of the donor mare at the time of mating.</li>
	  			<li>A foal resulting from a frozen embryo/ovum transfer shall not be eligible for registration.</li>
