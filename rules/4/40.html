			<h3>4.40 Dead Heat</h3>
			<p>When the judges cannot separate two or more horses as to their finishing position at the finish of a race. All un-separated horses are considered to be tied for that finish position. In the event of a dead heat in any position(s), points and purses will be divided and/or shared. By way of example, horses finishing in a dead heat for any place other than 5th place will divide points and purse money between the next place with the exception of 5th place which shall be an equal division of 5th place money and points. </p>
