			<h3>5.09 Photo Finish, Head Numbers &#8211; Starting Gate</h3>
			<p>At all member tracks where pari-mutuel wagering is allowed, a photo finish and starting gate must be used. <strong>Head numbers shall not be permitted at extended pari-mutuel tracks. At non-extended meetings/fairs, the use of head numbers is permitted.</strong> At all extended pari-mutuel meetings the track member must provide for a back-up starting gate. Photo finish equipment shall not be acceptable unless a stationary camera, mounted above the finish wire and perpendicular to the race track, is employed along with a spinner or stationary target or acceptable software application shall be used. In addition, no camera utilizing a shutter between the film and the race track during the actual finish of a race or which has a field of view greater than 12 inches at the finish line shall be considered acceptable equipment. It shall be the duty of the presiding judge to verify that the photo finish equipment is in working order prior to each racing program.</p>
