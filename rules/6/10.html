		<h3>6.10 Judges&#39; Authority</h3>
		<p>
			The judges shall have authority to:
			<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li>(a) Inflict fines and penalties, as prescribed by these Rules.</li>
				<li>(b) Determine all questions of fact relating to the race.</li>
				<li>(c) Decide any differences between parties to the race, or any contingent matter which shall arise, such as are not otherwise provided for in these Rules.</li>
				<li>(d) Declare pools and bets "off" in case of fraud, no appeal to be allowed from their decision in that respect. All pools and bets follow the decision of the judges. Such a decision in respect to pools and bets shall be made at the conclusion of the race upon the observations of the judges and upon such facts as an immediate investigation may develop. A reversal or change of decision after the official placing at the conclusion of the heat or race shall not affect the distribution of betting pools made upon such official placing. Control the horses, drivers, trainers and other participants and punish by a fine or by suspension or expulsion, any such person who shall fail to obey their orders or the rules. In no case shall there be any compromise or change on the part of the judges of punishment prescribed in the Rules, but the same shall be strictly enforced. Track members shall not remove or modify any fine imposed by the judges of a race, review any order of suspension, expulsion or interfere with the judges performing their duties.</li>
				<li>(e) Examine all parties connected with a race as to any wrong or complaint. Any person required to appear before the judges for a hearing or examination who shall fail to appear after due notice in writing shall be penalized. </li>
				<li>(f) Consider complaints of foul from the owners, trainers or drivers in the race and no others.</li>
