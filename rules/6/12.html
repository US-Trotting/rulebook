				<li>(b) Observe the preliminary warming up of horses and scoring, noting behavior of horses, lameness, equipment, conduct of the drivers, changes in odds at pari-mutuel meetings and any unusual incidents pertaining to horses or drivers participating in races.</li>
				<li>(c) One of the judges shall be designated to lock the pari-mutuel machines immediately upon the horses reaching the official starting point. Be in communication with the patrol judges/starter, from the time the Starter picks up the horses until the finish of the race. Any violation or near violation of the rules shall be reported by the patrol judge/starter witnessing the incident and a written record made of same. At least one judge shall observe the drivers throughout the stretch specifically noting changing course, interference, improper use of whips, breaks and failure to contest the race to the finish.</li>
				<li>(d) Post the "objection" sign, or "inquiry" sign, on the odds board in the case of a complaint or possible rule violation, and immediately notify the announcer of the objection or inquiry and the horse or horses involved.

In all instances the Judges shall post the order of finish and the "official" sign as soon as they have made their decision. In addition the Judges shall cause the "inquiry" sign to be posted whenever there has been an accident during the course of the race.</li>
