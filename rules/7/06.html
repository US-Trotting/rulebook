		<h3>7.06 Tattoo/Freeze Brand/ Microchip Requirements</h3>
		<p>No horse that has not been tattooed or freeze branded and implanted with a microchip as authorized by the USTA will be permitted to start at an extended pari-mutuel meeting unless the permission of the presiding judge is obtained and arrangements are made to have the horse tattooed or freeze branded or implanted with a microchip. Any person refusing to allow a horse to be tattooed/freeze branded/micro-chipped by a USTA representative may be fined, suspended or expelled, or further applications for registrations submitted by such person may be refused.</p>
		<p>No horse may start in any race at an extended pari-mutuel or any other meeting unless it is fully identified. The burden of establishing the identity of a horse rests with the person or persons having charge of the horse at the meeting, and in connection therewith any person found guilty of fraud or attempted fraud or any person who aids in any way in the perpetration of a fraud or any person who participates in any attempt at fraud shall be expelled. Provided further that the provisions of this section shall not be interpreted as relieving the paddock judge and/or the identifier from any responsibilities outlined in Rule 6.17 and 6.18.</p>
