		<h3>9.05 Reporting of Change in Ownership During Current Year</h3>
		<p>
			At extended pari-mutuel meetings, in the event there is a change in ownership after an electronic eligibility has been issued, the current registration certificates of the horse shall be immediately delivered to any licensed official of the USTA. If the horse is to be leased, an original executed copy of said lease shall be delivered therewith. Said official shall examine such registration certificate to verify that it is in proper order and that the current registered owner is the same as the current holder of the eligibility certificate and that all new owners / beneficial owners are members of the USTA in good standing. If the endorsements are satisfactory said official shall forward the registration certificate or the lease to the Registrar for proper transfer or recording of lease as the case may be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Failure to forward the registration certificate or an executed copy of the lease within twenty days after a change of ownership of a horse that is racing will subject each new owner / beneficial owner to a fine.
